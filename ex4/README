=  Description:  =
==================

PrimesDensityVisualizer.java uses the classes Point.java which represents a two dimensional point and class
PrimesEnumerator.java which tests primality and generates prime numbers in a specified range to presents the 
density of prime numbers, and compare it to the approximation function. it also uses the class Plotter.java 
to draw two lines through the points the functions meet.
